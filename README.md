# Setup:
    # Make sure you have nvm or a recen version of npm installed
    nvm use #(may need to run `nvm install` first) to get an appropriate npm version
    npm install # Install dependencies
    node build # Build the client code and watch for changes
    node src/server # Run the express server
    # You may want to keep both of these last two running in different tabs.

You should be able to visit localhost:3000 to test the client/server. Feel free to adjust the port if 3000 isn't convenient.
